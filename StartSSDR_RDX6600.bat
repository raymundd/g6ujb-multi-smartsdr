@REM N.B. Before using this script:
@REM Start SmartSDR and connect to first FlexRadio.
@REM Set the STATION name and then exit SmartSDR.
@REM Save the file %APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR.settings to another file with a unique name.
@REM Start SmartSDR and connect to the next FlexRadio.
@REM Set another unique STATION name and then exit SmartSDR.
@REM Save the file %APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR.settings to another file with a unique name.
@REM Now alter the script to match the location and names of the saved copies of settings file.

@REM Script now Copies the current settings to safer place - this is not entirely necessary since losing
@REM the settings file is not the end of the World, SmartSDR will just create a new one with defaults.
copy /Y "%APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR.settings" "%APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR_Orig.settings"

@REM Copy the pre-saved settings file as explained in the pre-amble above in to replace the current settings file.
copy /Y "%APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR_RDX6600.settings" "%APPDATA%\FlexRadio Systems\SSDR.settings"

@REM Launch a copy of SmartSDR - Please make sure that the path matches where your copy exists.
start "RDX6600" "%PROGRAMFILES%\FlexRadio Systems\SmartSDR v3.2.39\SmartSDR.exe"
